  <h1>Best browser(November 2017) </h1>
  <p id="fq">Were you asking what is the best browser of 2017(Novermber) ?
    Well,here is perfect place for the response ! </p>
    <h3>IT IS NOT 100% GOOD !IT IS JUST FROM WHAT I TESTED ON A VERY LOW PC !</h3>
    <p id="plong">Well,I am using Google Chrome as my default browser,and single on my computer .I will reinstall Firefox Quantum,in the beta .
      I recommand Chrome beacause it is moving very good and it has good performance .I tested more browsers,and they are: Chrome,firefox quantum edition,firefox developer edition,nightly(firefox nightly) and opera neon .
      In my opinion chrome is the best as performance,but firefox and opera neon are good and futuristic browsers with a very beautyful interface .Them are very good and I recommand them,but the speeds are slow .Neon is very slow,but fiefox is good .
      If you have a good pc it is ok,but my pc is not very good .I have very low specifications,so chrome is the best choice for me .
      Firefox Quantum is a very good variant for browsing for me !But i watch videos and I can't do this very good on Firefox .
      You can choose what you want and what you like ! </p>
